        Right when we <sup>landed</sup> <sub>on Athens</sub>, i felt something so magical about it that i cant explain.
        I saw the prettiest sunset in my life for the folloing 20 days. its pure happiness and peacefulness.
        I even thought to spend the rest of my life there. but im glad i could spend to much time and eat so many delicious foods and meet so many people.
        I felt truly happiness with only 18 years. <u>infinito</u>/10.

        FOurtunaly, i could visit Madri for the second time and i conclude that its the best capital in the whole world.
        I also went to <u>Granada, Malaga and Sevilla</u> and omg how these places can be so different but make me so happy.
        I personally prefer Granada, its freaking beautiful and so good to spend time on. For sure coming back. 100000/10.
